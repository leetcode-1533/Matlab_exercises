#Yingjie's Matlat exercise station

##OverView

***There*** are tons of interesting Matlab exercises which are highly linked with all kinds of science subject, such as encrypition physics and computing.

I am really eager to learn that.

#### Why so many files?

But due to Matlab Lanuage is very convient and efficient. The average time consuming for each project will not be that large. So I think create a repo for each subject will be a waste of time and doing so will inevitably rising the difficulty of program management.



So I am going to create a giant MATLAB repo, and in here, one or more commit will stand for a complete Matlab exercise. With the time goes on, I may will write some big Math program, and then I will point an individual repo to that project.



#### Fucture perspectives :
This should be a realy fascinating repo. There will countless picture with some .gif pictures included. And what's more, the knowledge inside is the treasure.

:) Wish you a good day. This is Yingjie again.
